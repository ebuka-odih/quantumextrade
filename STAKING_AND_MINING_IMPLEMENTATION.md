## TESTING CHECKLIST

### Staking Module
- [ ] Admin can create staking plans with crypto currency
- [ ] Users can view staking plans
- [ ] Users can subscribe to staking plans
- [ ] Users can view their staking subscriptions
- [ ] Users can cancel staking subscriptions
- [ ] Users can withdraw staking rewards

### Mining Module
- [ ] Admin can create mining plans
